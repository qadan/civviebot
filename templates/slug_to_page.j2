    <div class="content">
        <p>This is the endpoint for a CivvieBot API.</p>
        <p>If you got here from clicking a Webhook URL intended for Civilization 6:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open Civilization 6</li>
            <li>Select <b>Game Options</b> from the main menu</li>
            <li>Paste this link into the field near the bottom called <b>Play By Cloud Webhook URL</b></li>
            <li>Have the other players in your <b>Play By Cloud</b> game(s) follow the same steps</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once this is done, turns that you take in <b>Play By Cloud</b> games will be sent to CivvieBot and tracked in Discord.</p>
        <p>Note that this means <i>all</i> <b>Play By Cloud</b> games, so you'll want to remove the URL if you're taking a turn in a game you don't want tracked in Discord. You'll also want to make sure games have unique names so CivvieBot can tell them apart.</p>
        <p>You don't really need to worry about the <b>Play By Cloud Webhook Frequency</b> field; CivvieBot will only send out an initial ping once per turn, and can be configured to re-ping after a bit if someone is taking a long time.</p>
