<div class="content">
    <p>This is the endpoint for a CivvieBot API.</p>
    <p>If you got here from clicking a Webhook URL intended for Civilization 6:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open Civilization 6</li>
        <li>Select <b>Game Options</b> from the main menu</li>
        <li>Paste this link into the field near the bottom called <b>Play By Cloud Webhook URL</b></li>
        <li>Have the other players in your <b>Play By Cloud</b> game(s) follow the same steps</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You don't really need to worry about the <b>Play By Cloud Webhook Frequency</b> field; as long as everyone in the
        game has done step 4, you should be good to go either way.</p>
    <p>There are a couple of other things before CivvieBot actually starts tracking and pinging a game; use <span
            class="font-monospace bg-light">/{{ command_prefix }} quickstart</span> for details.</p>
