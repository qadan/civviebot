What should I set Play By Cloud Webhook Frequency to?
There _are_ some reports around the internet that **Every Turn** has some weird reliability issues, so you may as well set it to **My Turn** to be on the safe side. However, it doesn't really matter, as long as I get the notifications. I ping on my own schedule (once per player per turn, plus configured reminder pings), and I only use the notifications coming from Civilization 6 to track games and establish that schedule. At least if you set it to **My Turn**, I won't be getting more notifications than necessary ðŸ™‚.
