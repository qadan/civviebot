What should I set Play By Cloud Webhook Frequency to?
It doesn't really matter; CivvieBot will only ping once per new turn anyway. At least if you set it to **My Turn** you won't be pinging me more than necessary ðŸ™‚. There's some reports around the internet that **Every Turn** has poor reliability though, so you may as well set it to **My Turn** to be on the safe side.
