How do I change the settings for a game?
When I start tracking a game, it inherits the settings for the URL tracking it, so the easiest way is actually to set up the URL how you want it before you start the game, either initially when you make a URL with `/%COMMAND_PREFIX%url_manage new`, or later using `/%COMMAND_PREFIX%url_manage edit`

If a game is already running, you can change its settings with `/%COMMAND_PREFIX%game_manage edit`.
