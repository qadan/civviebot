How do I get pinged by my @username when it's my turn?
By linking yourself to a player I'm tracking using `/%COMMAND_PREFIX%self link`, or clicking the `This is me` button when it's your turn.

**But I don't see my player in the list**

I start tracking players after getting at least one turn notification from Civilization 6 directed at that player, even if it was too early in the game to actually ping them. Once I'm tracking a player, they can be linked to a Discord user; before that, I can't link you.
