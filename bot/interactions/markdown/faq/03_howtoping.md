How do I get pinged by my @username when it's my turn?
By linking yourself to a player I'm tracking using `/%COMMAND_PREFIX%self link`, or clicking the `This is me` button when I ping your turn.2

The link will be maintained for future games with the same player in the same channel.

**But I don't see myself in the list**

I start tracking players after getting at least one turn notification from Civilization 6 directed at that player (even if the game is muted or it was too early in the game to actually ping them). Once I'm tracking a player, they can be linked to a Discord user; before that, I can't link you, so you'll have to wait until that happens.

If it's been several turns and you don't see your name in the list, it probably means that the player who takes their turn before you doesn't have things set up correctly; use `/%COMMAND_PREFIX% quickstart` for setup instructions.
