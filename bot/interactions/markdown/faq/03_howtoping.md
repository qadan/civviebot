How do I get pinged by my @username when it's my turn?
I start tracking players after getting at least one turn notification from Civilization 6 directed at that player, even if it was too early to actually ping them. Once I'm tracking a player, they can be linked to a Discord user.

When I pop a turn notification for an untracked player, you'll see a button under it that says `This is me`. Clicking on that button will link the player and your Discord ID, so when it's your turn again, it'll ping you directly instead.

If the notification is gone, or passed too long ago, or if it's too early in the game for me to pop turn notifications, you can use `/%COMMAND_PREFIX%self link`. Users given access to the `/%COMMAND_PREFIX%player` commands can also manage the links between any players.
