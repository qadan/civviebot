How do I remove a link between a player and a Discord user?
You can always click or re-click the link button on a notification if it's recent enough. Otherwise, you can use one of either `/%COMMAND_PREFIX%self unlink` to search for a player to unlink from yourself, or `/%COMMAND_PREFIX%player_manage unlinkplayer` and `/%COMMAND_PREFIX%player_manage unlinkuser` can be used if you have permission to edit anyone's links.

The link will be maintained for future games with the same player using the same URL.
