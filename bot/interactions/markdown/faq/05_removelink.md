How do I remove a link between a player and a Discord user?
You can always click or re-click the link button on a notification if it's recent enough. Otherwise, you can use one of either `/%COMMAND_PREFIX%self unlink` to search for a player to unlink from yourself, or `/%COMMAND_PREFIX%player unlink` if you have permission to edit anyone's links.
