How do I remove a link between a player and a Discord user?
You can always click or re-click the link button on a notification if it's recent enough. Otherwise, you can use one of either `/%COMMAND_PREFIX%self unlinkplayer` to search for a player to unlink from yourself.

The link will be maintained for future games using the same URL.
