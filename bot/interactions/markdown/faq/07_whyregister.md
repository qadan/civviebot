Why do I have to manually add games?
Games have to be manually added because allowing any game to talk to me is a security hole.

The only thing I can use to validate that a notification was really meant to be sent to me is the fact that it was sent to a real URL that I made. If I allowed notifications to automatically create games, anyone with the URL could spam the channel with messages, even if they're not in the channel.

It might be nice to try to mitigate that in the future, but for now, manually telling me about a game is how I know a message going to your URL is likely to be real.
