# CivvieBot

CivvieBot is a Discord bot that can generate Webhook URLs for use with the Cloud Play feature in Civilization 6. Users paste the URL into the settings for Civilization 6, and the bot then pings turn notifications from those players' Cloud Play games in the channel it was created in. Users in that channel can also link themselves to players in the game, allowing them to get actual notifications by their Discord account instead of just their in-game player name.

## @TODO:

* Test the current list of commands
* Add in role limitations for the more 'admin'-y commands
* Add in optional role limitations for user linking
* Test with Civ 6 instead of Postman
* Complete README
