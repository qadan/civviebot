'''
Models for types of entities in CivvieBot's database.

Turn notifications from Civilization 6 contain no uniquely identifying information. The goal of
these models (besides stashing config) is to allow turn notifications to be stashed with a unique
game and player by linking them back to the webhook URL they came from, and to make it easy to ask
about a game's current turn.
