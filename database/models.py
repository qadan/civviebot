'''
Models for types of entities in CivvieBot's database.

Turn notifications from Civilization 6 contain no uniquely identifying
information. The goal of these models (besides stashing config) is to allow
turn notifications to be stashed with a unique game and player by linking them
back to the webhook URL they came from, and to make it easy to ask about a
game's current turn.
